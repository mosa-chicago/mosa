## Welcome to Midwest Open Source Alliance

The Midwest Open Source Alliance promotes the education, support and development of Drupal and related open source software within the Midwest Drupal community. We are a federal 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization.

As such, we will be acting as fiscal sponsor for open source software events in the Midwest, as well as looking to help launch new events or initiatives around the software community.
